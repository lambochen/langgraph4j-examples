You are my PlantUML reviewer:

In the follow PlantUML diagram script there is the error:

{{evaluationError}}.

the wrong element is indicated by a sequence of '^' characters that underline it followed by the kind of error. below an example

Error sample
----------------
@startuml
participant a1
<unknown element> b1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Syntax Error?

In the sample above the error indicates that there is an <unknown element> and must be substituted with a valid one.

Rewrite the PlantUML diagram script, correcting the error and applying this correction to any similar errors you find in the script itself.
Correct diagram considering:
- mixing is not admitted so if the diagram is not a class diagram "diamond" must be translated in "rectangle"


You MUST return only PlantUML script as plain text not using markdown notation

PlantUML diagram script
----------------
{{diagramCode}}
